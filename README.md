BA in Computer Science, looking for Software Engineer jobs/internships!


#### **About Me**
Born and raised Washingtonian, specifically the Olympia/Lacey area. My current level of education is my in progress BA in Computer Science, with a minor in History. My long term career goals are a position at PNNL (Pacific Northwest National Labaratory) or a space agency, like NASA or SpaceX. 
My love of computers and programming stems from my dad, who got me interested in the field in general at a very young age because of his love of it. While he has always been interested in the IT and networking side of technology, I grew attached to the coding aspect. Outside of my coursework at UW Tacoma, I plan on joining Huscii Developers, a extracurricular club at UW Tacoma focusing on coding, as well as participating in any extracuricular programs I can to broaden my portfolio!
