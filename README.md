## **Welcome to My Portfolio!**
My name is Ethan Pitroff, an undergraduate student at UW Tacoma enrolled in the Computer Science major. My primary interest is in software development and engineering.
BA in Computer Science, looking for Software Engineer jobs/internships!


## **About Me**
Born and raised Washingtonian, specifically the Olympia/Lacey area. My current level of education is my in progress BA in Computer Science, with a minor in History. My long term career goals are a position at PNNL (Pacific Northwest National Labaratory) or a space agency, like NASA or SpaceX. 
My love of computers and programming stems from my dad, who got me interested in the field in general at a very young age because of his love of it. While he has always been interested in the IT and networking side of technology, I grew attached to the coding aspect. Outside of my coursework at UW Tacoma, I plan on joining Huscii Developers, a extracurricular club at UW Tacoma focusing on coding, as well as participating in any extracuricular programs I can to broaden my portfolio!
